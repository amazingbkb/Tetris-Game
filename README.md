A Brower Tetris Game

## How to Play

A Tetromino will show up from the top of the screen. You can move the Tetromino around, either left to right and/or you can rotate them. The Tetromino fall at a certain rate, but you can make them fall faster if you’re sure of your positioning. Your objective is to get all the Tetromino to fill all the empty space in a line at the bottom of the screen; whenever you do this, you’ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.

A goal gives us a reason to play the game. Tetris offers an incredibly simple reason to play—pitting your wits against the computerized block dropper in order to last as long as you can.

Tetris has very simple rules: you can only move the pieces in specific ways; your game is over if your pieces reach the top of the screen; and you can only remove pieces from the screen by filling all the blank space in a line.

Once the Tetrimino reach to the top your game is over. Challenge your highest points.
